This is a Q-learning algorithm written in Processing.org language. (screenshot: http://sandropaganotti.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ishot-88.png)

Here's the properties you can change in this program
// game properties
float start_q  = 0.0;
float start_e  = 0.0;
float start_r  = 0.0;
float a_param  = 0.1;
float g_param  = 1;      // finite horizont
float l_param  = 0.9;
float e_param  = 0.01;   // greedy action - not yet implemented


int grid_width = 25;
int grid_height = 25;
int start_state_x = 1;
int start_state_y = 1;
int goal_x = 4;
int goal_y = 20;
int action_nr  = 4;
